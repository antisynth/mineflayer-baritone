# mineflayer-baritone

Because I decided I don't like mineflayer-pathfinder (and also for fun), I made Baritone for Mineflayer. A lot of the code is inspired by mineflayer-pathfinder

Also unlike mineflayer-pathfinder and Baritone, it can do (some) parkour :)

NOTE: This is highly experimental and probably won't be fully functional for a while
